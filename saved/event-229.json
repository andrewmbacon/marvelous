Heroes will die. Villains and heroes will form allegiances. Empires will fall. A destructive force punctures through the edge of our universe and slaughters millions of worlds – including Xandar, home of the intergalactic peacekeeping force known as the Nova Corps. With the Nova Corps gone, who can possibly hold off the Annihilation Wave? To protect the legacy of the Xandarian culture, the lone surviving member of the Corps – Richard Rider of Earth – must escape from the burning ruins of the homeworld with the murdering hosts of the Annihilation Wave closing in. But can he trust himself to use his new power wisely, or will he lose control again and pose a threat to the cosmos greater than the invasion itself? And on the subject of trust, how far can he trust his new “friend”... Drax? Plus: Just how did Drax end up on Xandar, anyway? His story begins with the crash of an interstellar prison transport in an isolated Alaskan town. And when Paibok the Power Skrull, Lunatik, the Blood Brothers and Drax the Destroyer come calling, it's not a social call. You think you know Drax?
