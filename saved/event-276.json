First there was the cosmos saving. Then there was the betrayal. Now there’s the breakup. As Star-Lord’s squad head off on their own pursuits, a universe of innocents asks, “Where are our Guardians?” Fear not, helpless citizen of the stars, for a new team has risen and they are ready to put a beat down on any bad guys bent on destruction! These new Guardians include the brew-slurping Bug; the time-lost Major Victory, Gamora, the green-skinned assassin with mental issues; and an angry walking tree named Groot — all led by Rocket Raccon, a talking mammal with his raygun set on a hair-trigger. Just as the sabers begin rattling in the War of Kings, outer space’s elite cadre of saviors has seen better days. Feel guarded now?
